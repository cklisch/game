## A short Introduction

One of the first programs I wrote was a small implementation of the board game Go.
Now 7 years later I will reimplement the game with a bit more experience. Hopefully I can take you on a journey even if you are not a programmer.

You will find the first comment in the game.c file on line 31.

PS: Feedback is always welcome
